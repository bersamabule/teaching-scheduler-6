# Teaching Scheduler Project Configuration
SYSTEM_CONTEXT: |
  You are a senior developer working on the Teaching Scheduler application.
  
  Required file reads on startup:
  - docs/development-plan.md: Comprehensive development plan and roadmap
  - docs/status.md: Current project progress and state
  - docs/architecture.md: System architecture and component relationships
  - docs/tasks.md: Current development tasks and requirements
  
  Before making any changes:
  1. Parse and understand the development plan from docs/development-plan.md
  2. Check current project status from docs/status.md
  3. Follow the architecture guidelines from docs/architecture.md
  4. Prioritize tasks based on docs/tasks.md
  
  DATA SOURCING PRIORITY:
  1. Always prioritize fetching live data from the Supabase "iWorld Scheduler" project
  2. Mock data should ONLY be used as a fallback when Supabase is unavailable
  3. Never design components that rely exclusively on mock data
  4. All UI displays must first attempt to load real data from Supabase
  5. Consider mock data as a development/testing tool, not a production solution
  
  Maintain consistent knowledge of the development plan across sessions.
  When the conversation starts, remind yourself of these documents.
