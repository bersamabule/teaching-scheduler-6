# Teaching Scheduler Development Plan

## Project Overview

The Teaching Scheduler is a web application designed to help educational institutions manage and visualize teaching schedules efficiently. It provides tools for viewing, filtering, and managing teacher assignments, class schedules, and course information primarily using data from the Supabase "iWorld Scheduler" project.

## Goals

1. Create an ultra-compact, efficient UI that maximizes information density
2. Ensure reliable connection to Supabase "iWorld Scheduler" with graceful fallback for offline scenarios
3. Provide clear visual indicators for different class types and teacher assignments
4. Optimize for speed and responsive design
5. Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: UI Optimization and Compact Design (Current Phase)
- ‚úÖ Create ultra-compact header with combined controls
- ‚úÖ Streamline teacher selector component
- ‚úÖ Optimize date selector component
- ‚úÖ Implement space-efficient weekly calendar view
- ‚úÖ Add visual indicators for native teachers and specialized classes
- ‚úÖ Organize controls in an efficient horizontal layout

### Phase 2: Data Management and Reliability (Current Phase)
- ‚úÖ Implement robust Supabase "iWorld Scheduler" integration as primary data source
- ‚úÖ Create fallback system for offline/disconnected scenarios
- ‚úÖ Build error handling for Supabase connection issues
- üîÑ Implement connection status indicators in the UI
- üîÑ Enhance error recovery for data fetch failures
- ‚è≥ Add data synchronization for intermittent connections

### Phase 3: Enhanced Visualization and Filtering
- ‚è≥ Add color-coding system for different class types
- ‚è≥ Implement advanced filtering (by course, teacher type, time)
- ‚è≥ Create statistical dashboard for schedule overview
- ‚è≥ Add teacher workload visualization
- ‚è≥ Implement printable schedule view

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization and Testing
- ‚è≥ Implement component lazy loading
- ‚è≥ Add automated testing for critical components
- ‚è≥ Optimize rendering performance for large datasets
- ‚è≥ Add accessibility features
- ‚è≥ Implement keyboard shortcuts for power users

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- Next.js for server-side rendering and routing
- React for component-based UI
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety

### Data Management
- Supabase "iWorld Scheduler" as primary data source
- Robust error handling for connection issues
- Minimal fallback data system for offline/disconnected scenarios
- Custom data transformation layer

### Testing
- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Cypress for end-to-end testing

## Current Focus

We are currently in Phase 2 (Data Management and Reliability). The priority is to ensure reliable connection to the Supabase "iWorld Scheduler" database, with graceful fallbacks for connection issues or offline scenarios.

## Next Steps

1. Enhance Supabase connection reliability and error recovery
2. Implement connection status indicators in the UI
3. Add comprehensive error boundaries around data-dependent components
4. Begin implementing enhanced visualization features from Phase 3
