# Teaching Scheduler Development Plan

## Project Overview

The Teaching Scheduler is a web application designed to help educational institutions manage and visualize teaching schedules efficiently. It provides tools for viewing, filtering, and managing teacher assignments, class schedules, and course information primarily using data from the Supabase "iWorld Scheduler" project.

## Goals

1. Create an ultra-compact, efficient UI that maximizes information density
2. Ensure reliable connection to Supabase "iWorld Scheduler" with graceful fallback for offline scenarios
3. Provide clear visual indicators for different class types and teacher assignments
4. Optimize for speed and responsive design
5. Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: UI Optimization and Compact Design (Completed)
- ✅ Create ultra-compact header with combined controls
- ✅ Streamline teacher selector component
- ✅ Optimize date selector component
- ✅ Implement space-efficient weekly calendar view
- ✅ Add visual indicators for native teachers and specialized classes
- ✅ Organize controls in an efficient horizontal layout

### Phase 2: Data Management and Reliability (Completed)
- ✅ Implement robust Supabase "iWorld Scheduler" integration as primary data source
- ✅ Create fallback system for offline/disconnected scenarios
- ✅ Build error handling for Supabase connection issues
- ✅ Implement connection status indicators in the UI
- ✅ Enhance error recovery for data fetch failures
- ✅ Add data synchronization for intermittent connections

### Phase 3: Enhanced Visualization and Tools (Completed)
- ✅ Implement Database Explorer for direct data inspection
- ✅ Fix Database Explorer to only show actual tables from Supabase
- ✅ Enhance column display for better data visibility
- ✅ Add color-coding system for different class types
- ✅ Implement advanced filtering (by course, teacher type) in `WeeklyCalendar`
- ✅ Create statistical dashboard (`/dashboard`) with charts
- ✅ Add teacher workload visualization (counts in `TeacherSelect` dropdown)
- ✅ Implement printable schedule view (print CSS and button)

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization and Testing (Current Phase)
- ✅ Optimize rendering performance for large datasets (Database Explorer virtualization)
- ⏳ Implement component lazy loading
- ⏳ Add automated testing for critical components (Unit/Integration)
- ⏳ Address Mobile Responsiveness
- ⏳ Perform Bundle Size Analysis
- ⏳ Add accessibility features
- ⏳ Implement keyboard shortcuts for power users

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- Next.js for server-side rendering and routing
- React for component-based UI
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety

### Data Management
- Supabase "iWorld Scheduler" as primary data source
- Robust error handling for connection issues
- Minimal fallback data system for offline/disconnected scenarios
- Custom data transformation layer

### Database Explorer
- Direct connection to Supabase database
- Dynamic table discovery
- Accurate representation of database structure
- Wide column display for better data readability
- Robust error handling and recovery
- Optimized rendering using list virtualization (`react-window`)

### Testing
- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Cypress for end-to-end testing

## Current Focus

We are currently in Phase 4 (Performance Optimization and Testing). Having completed the core Database Explorer functionality and fixed issues with Supabase connection reliability, our focus is now on enhancing data visualization and implementing additional tools for schedule management.

## Recent Accomplishments

1. ✅ Fixed Database Explorer to accurately show only tables that exist in Supabase
2. ✅ Enhanced column width display in Database Explorer for better data visibility
3. ✅ Improved connection reliability with Supabase
4. ✅ Implemented robust error handling throughout the application
5. ✅ Added comprehensive error boundaries to prevent UI crashes
6. ✅ Optimized Database Explorer table rendering using virtualization (`react-window`)

## Recent Improvements

### Teacher Filtering Enhancement
- ✅ Fixed issue with teacher filtering where calendar view was empty when teacher was selected
- ✅ Enhanced teacher-calendar data association with more robust field matching
- ✅ Added support for multiple field name variations (case-insensitive)
- ✅ Implemented fallback matching for NT-Led classes for native teachers
- ✅ Added extensive logging to aid troubleshooting and debugging
- ✅ Improved error handling and empty result state detection

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Enhance user experience for teacher filtering (Indicator and empty state)
   - ✅ Add clear visual indication when filters are active
   - ✅ Implement empty state UI when no classes match filters
   - ✅ Improve teacher info display with schedule statistics (in dropdown)
2. ⏳ Standardize teacher references across data sources
3. ✅ Complete statistical dashboard for schedule overview (Initial version complete)
4. ✅ Implement teacher workload visualization (Initial version complete in dropdown)
5. ✅ Create printable schedule view (Complete)
6. ⏳ Continue performance optimization (Mobile responsiveness, Bundle size)
7. ⏳ Begin implementing automated testing
8. ⏳ Document best practices for Supabase integration
