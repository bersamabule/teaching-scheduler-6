# Project Status Summary

## Current Status
The Teaching Scheduler 6 project is currently in Phase 2 (Data Management and Reliability) of development. We have successfully implemented core UI components and established robust data management with error handling capabilities.

## Recent Accomplishments

### Error Boundary Implementation
- ✅ Created a comprehensive error boundary system
- ✅ Implemented error boundaries around critical components (TeacherSelect, DateSelect, WeeklyCalendar)
- ✅ Added error boundaries to database explorer components
- ✅ Integrated error reporting with MCP console monitor
- ✅ Documented the error boundary architecture and best practices

### Connection Reliability
- ✅ Enhanced Supabase connection with retry logic
- ✅ Implemented ConnectionStatusIndicator component
- ✅ Created fallback system for offline scenarios
- ✅ Added visual indicators for fallback mode

### Data Synchronization
- ✅ Implemented data synchronization for intermittent connections
- ✅ Created SynchronizationIndicator component for visual feedback
- ✅ Integrated components with the synchronization system
- ✅ Added fallback registration and automatic data refresh

### Enhanced Visualization
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive color-coding system for different class types
- ✅ Added advanced filtering capabilities by course type
- ✅ Created clearer visual indicators for NT-Led classes
- ✅ Enhanced the schedule display with improved information density

## Current Development Focus
- Continuing implementation of enhanced visualization features
- Beginning work on deployment pipeline automation
- Improving performance for large datasets
- Enhancing mobile responsiveness

## Ready for Next Session
All critical components now have proper error handling with appropriate fallback UIs, ensuring the application remains functional even when errors occur. The next development session should focus on:

1. Completing data synchronization for intermittent connections
2. Beginning implementation of enhanced visualization features (color-coding, advanced filtering)
3. Improving the deployment pipeline automation

## Documentation Status
- All major components are documented
- Error boundary implementation is fully documented
- Development plan and tasks are up-to-date
- MCP server integration is documented

## Known Issues
- Edge case handling for specific error scenarios in the database explorer
- Mobile responsiveness needs further optimization
- Testing coverage is incomplete
