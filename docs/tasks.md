## Task Details

### Supabase Integration Improvements

Enhance the reliability and performance of Supabase "iWorld Scheduler" integration:

1. Implement connection health monitoring
2. Add intelligent retry logic for failed requests
3. Create proper error handling for all API calls
4. Provide clear UI feedback during connection issues
5. Add data synchronization for reconnection scenarios

### Automated Deployment Setup

Configure and implement automated deployment using MCP servers:

1. Set up Docker MCP Server for container management
2. Configure Kubernetes MCP Server for production deployment
3. Implement CLI MCP Server for secure script execution
4. Create GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD pipeline
5. Add monitoring and automated rollback capabilities

### MCP Integration Enhancement

Improve the Model Context Protocol integration to leverage its full capabilities:

1. Expand console monitoring capabilities for error tracking and debugging
2. Set up secure file system access for configuration and log management
3. Add code analysis tools for development optimization
4. Implement external API access through standardized MCP interfaces
5. Create custom MCP roots for Teaching Scheduler-specific functionality

### Fallback System Enhancements

Improve the fallback system that activates only when Supabase is unavailable:

1. Ensure minimal but functional dataset for essential features
2. Add clear visual indicators when using fallback data
3. Implement data synchronization when connection is restored
4. Minimize differences in UI behavior between primary and fallback modes

### Error Boundaries Implementation

Add React error boundaries to prevent UI crashes:

1. Create ErrorBoundary component with fallback UI
2. Wrap major sections of the application
3. Add error logging to capture issues through MCP console monitor
4. Ensure user can continue working even if a component fails

### UI Enhancements

Improve the visual aspects of the UI:

1. Add loading indicators for async operations
2. Ensure proper mobile responsiveness
3. Add visual feedback for user actions
4. Improve accessibility (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
